Felicia's moral compass is often ambiguous; she is driven by her own code of honor rather than societal norms, which sometimes puts her at odds with both heroes and villains.\n\nDespite her criminal career, Black Cat has a complicated relationship with Spider-Man. She deeply cares for him and has, at times, fought alongside him against common enemies. However, her desire for independence and her unwillingness to conform to the role of a traditional hero often leads her down a more self-serving path."
